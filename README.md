# Real-Time-Oil-Spill-Detection-Using-SAR-Images
This project implements a real-time oil spill detection system using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The system leverages computer vision techniques to detect dark grey regions in SAR images that may indicate the presence of oil spills in marine environments.
